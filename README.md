Hello, 
This was a passion project of mine as my family doesnt speak english and 
I wanted to create a game where they can play and understand. 
I hope you enjoy.
Concept:
I collected multiple 5-letter Spanish words and created a dictionary. 
This game is similar to normal Wordle, but the program assumes you are using an English keyboard. 
It will autocorrect you if you attempt to use an accent for one of the 5 letters. In this case,
if the word has an accent, it will turn orange instead of grey, yellow, or green. At the end, 
the secret word will appear with its English translation.
